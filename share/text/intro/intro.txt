^7Dark Cave

^:You are in a dark room.

It is pitch-black in here!  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.

There is a sword here.

^7Dark Cave

^:You take the sword.

Swords don't give off light!  You can vaguely hear grue-like sounds.

There is a torch here.
----
^7Dark Cave (still)

^:Hmm.  The torch is lit and everything, but you still can't see anything.

The grue-like sounds are getting very close!

There is an SDL library here.
