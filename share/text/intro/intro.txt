^2Dark Tunnel

^<You take the magic wand.  Are you a wizard?

The wand doesn't have any magic left in it!  You can vaguely hear
grue-like sounds.

There is a lantern on the wall here.

^2> ^=light the lantern

^2Dark Tunnel (still)

^<You light the lantern, but you still can't see anything.  Strange.

The grue-like sounds are getting very close!
