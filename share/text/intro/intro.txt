^7Dark Cave

^:You take the magic wand.  Are you a wizard?

The wand doesn't have any magic left in it!  You can vaguely hear
grue-like sounds.

There is a torch on the wall here.

^7> ^5light the torch

^7Dark Cave (still)

^:You light the torch, but you still can't see anything.  Strange.

The grue-like sounds are getting very close!

There is an SDL library here.
